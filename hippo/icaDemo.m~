%% convert demodulated complex data to real valued w/ 2x dimensionality, 
%% run fastICA, then bin and render activations.
% Inputs:
% Xf = filtered data (for example 64x100000 complex valued matrix is 64 electrodes at 100000 sampled timepoints.
% v = time course of 1st PC (determined by [~,~,v] = svds(Xf,1); -- svds is a matlab builtin function).
% Outputs:
% A = ICA mixing matrix, contains projections of each component onto electrode space.
% W = ICA unmixing matrix, extracts component activations from original electrode space.
% t = IC activations
% CAVEAT: electrode space is 2*(x+1) dimensions, where x is the number of
% electrodes. +1 because, in addition to electrode values, I feed in a value 
% that captures the evolution of v; 2* because of real and imaginary components fed into ICA.
