KMBOX - Kernel Methods Toolbox
a MATLAB toolbox for nonlinear signal processing and machine learning

ABOUT
=====

The Kernel Methods Toolbox (KMBOX) is a collection of MATLAB programs that 
implement kernel-based algorithms, with a focus on adaptive filtering 
algorithms. It can be used for nonlinear signal processing and machine 
learning.

KMBOX includes implementations of algorithms such as kernel principal 
component analysis (KPCA), kernel canonical correlation analysis (KCCA) and 
kernel recursive least-squares (KRLS).

The goal of this distribution is to provide easy-to-analyze algorithm 
implementations, which reveal the inner mechanics of each algorithm and 
allow for quick modifications. The focus of these implementations is 
therefore on readability rather than speed or memory usage.

The basis of this toolbox was a set of programs written for the Ph.D. Thesis 
"Kernel Methods for Nonlinear Identification, Equalization and Separation of 
Signals", by Steven Van Vaerenbergh in 2009.

Template files are provided to encourage external authors to include their 
own code into the toolbox.

INSTALLATION
============

Extract the zip file. Add the toolbox' main folder and subfolders to the 
MATLAB path.


USAGE
=====

The name of each function uses the prefix "km_" to minimize interference 
with other toolboxes. Usage of each function is specified in the function 
file itself.

Most algorithms have a corresponding demonstration file in the "demo" folder 
that bears the suffix "_demo". These programs can be executed without 
setting any additional parameters.

The code uses the following conventions:
- For data matrices, data is stored and accessed in row format: each data 
  point is a row in the data matrix.


EXTENDING KMBOX
===============

The files "km_template.m" in the base directory and "km_template_demo" in 
the "/demo" directory can be used as basic templates to extend KMBOX.

If you want to have your programs included in the KMBOX distribution on 
sourceforge, please email them to steven (at) gtas.dicom.unican.es. Do 
include at least one "demo" file for each algorithm.
